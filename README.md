# Dohyeon
Woowahan Brothers Inc. is a leading food-tech company in Korea. It provides the food delivery application ‘Baedal Minjok,’ which is known for no commission fees. It also has a service focused on delivering food from famous restaurants, named ‘Baemin Riders’, and is the number one mobile grocery store, ‘Baemin Chan.’ It has developed a set of fonts that are provided for everybody, from designers to restaurant owners. The fonts are named after our employee’s kids’ names, like Hanna and Jua. Badal Minjok’s fonts are inspired by Korean signage from the 1960s and 70s, Jeju’s taffy handcart, faded toilet sign in the parks of Homigot and Pohang, and so on. Baedal Minjok designs may not be classically beautiful, or follow the latest trends of professional designers. +Instead, they respect the lovely glances of normal people. 

Dohyeon was impressed by old signs that were elaborately lined on acrylic panel and cut off with rulers. The strokes of consonants and vowels are connected, with catches sight. The shape of consonants like “ㅅ,ㅈ,ㅎ” become different according to which vowels come after. Such rule is called Glyph, and it was first applied to Korean calligraphy in Dohyeon.
